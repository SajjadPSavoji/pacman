This project is a part of the course AI taught in University of Tehran.
It's main goal is to build an agent to play the role of pacman in the grid.
It's actions are based on search algorithms such as BFS , SFS , IDS and A*.

The problem desc is explained below:
- pacman is the object seeking foods. in the problem there might be multiple pacman instances
- pacman's world is a grid with walls(a maze) and It's goal is to collect all the foods with minimum moves
- to find optimal actoins for each pacman on of the afformentioned algorithms can be used.

in the report time complexity and number of moves needed for each algorithm is reported.
